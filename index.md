### For Prescription Drug Plan Sponsors:

Provide FHIR-formatted bulk claims data about plan enrollees to stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) sponsors in accordance with [Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892/text). Claims data can help PDP sponsors to better promote the appropriate use of medications and improve health outcomes and reduce a patient's burden in providing their medical history.

## Medicare claims data is information about healthcare experiences for Medicare beneficiaries

Business, organizations, and individual can all benefit from the power of claims data in applications and services.

Once upon a time...

Ben is a snowbird who spends his summers in Chicago and his winters in Florida. He is a traditional Medicare beneficiary (FFS, not MA) who recently had surgery at a hospital in Florida.

Ben was admitted to the hospital on January 2nd and had aortic valve replacement surgery on January 3rd. He was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on January 6th and discharged to his home on January 20th. During Ben’s stay at the skilled nursing facility, he is diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed amoxicillin.

Although Ben received services at a hospital - in addition to the costs associated with his hospital room and nursing care (Part A) - he also received services from several other providers (Part B), including a cardiac surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a radiologist, and others. This resulted in both Part A and Part B claims being submitted on behalf of Ben.

You are Ben’s primary care provider in Chicago. You see him for an annual visit in July. Because of the data shared through the DPC API, you have a clearer understanding of his care history, reducing the burden on both you and Ben, and improving the quality of care you’re able to give him.
